# Version 1.4
Release Notes

### ðŸ”¸ Fixes
- Important bug fix in the `$lan` command. [Issue #11](https://github.com/MrRecordHolder/pokecloud/issues/11)
- Fixed PokeCloud from reading othe bot commands [Issue #12](https://github.com/MrRecordHolder/pokecloud/issues/12)

### ðŸ”¹ New
- Sending & deleting messages in timed increments. Discord limits sending, editing, and deleting messages to 5 per 5 seconds. Anything more can cause errors and an API ban. A key feature for PokeCloud is sending, editing and deleting messages all at once. Just to put it into perspective, PokeCloud has 1300+ nests in the database. Every migration all of those listed nests are edited. This new feature will spead out the number of messages being sent, edited, and delete every second. Timers are calculated based on the key index number found AFTER filtering data then multiplied by 1500 milliseconds. These rates may change in later versions.
