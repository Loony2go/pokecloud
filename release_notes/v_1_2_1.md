# Version 1.2.1
Release Notes

### ðŸ”¸ Fixes
- Reporting nests on servers that have not set a timezone from V.1.2 release was causing errors calculating a timezone resulting in multiple errors causing the bot to crash. A value to the guildSettings key has be pushed manually to all servers without a set timezone. This will default to -4 (EST).

### ðŸ”¹ New
- `$vs` -> Now displays the servers active timezone.
