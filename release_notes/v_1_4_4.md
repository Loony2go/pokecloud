# Version 1.4.4
Release Notes

### ðŸ”¸ Fixes
- Bug in the `$report-nest` command causing species images to not properly save and the bot typing and not responding. This issue caused images to not properly display when using `$lan reported`. 

If your servers nests are not properly displaying images, you will need to re-report the nest(s) to update.

- Server alerts are sent a little faster to each server.
